    </header>

    <article>
      <p>
        Let's imagine you created a new feature and provided a feature flag for
        it. Required tests were added for "on" and "off" states, but one
        assertion was left without update for "on" state. You push your changes,
        the flag is "off", all tests are green. Yay! Changes are merged, code
        deployed, the feature flag is toggled and feature is released.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once the feature flag is toggled the very next CI run is failing. Since
        we forgot to update assertions for "on" state we troubled others and
        have to take care immidiatly.
      </p>

      <p>
        That can happen if you run e2e tests, use dynamic feature flags that can
        be toggled in a runtime and same set of flags used for staging
        enviroment. I have experience using
        <a src="https://www.split.io/">split.io</a> and it's a great tool, but
        dynamic power brings new challenges like I described above. What we can
        do about it?
      </p>

      <h2>Use less feature flags</h2>
      <p>
        Ease of adding a feature flag to every change comes with burden of
        mantaining, code and test complexities, forgotten flags.
      </p>

      <h2>Use static configuration</h2>
      <p>
        Yes tools like Split.io brings friendly UI that can be used by anyone in
        the company anytime, but most if you have efficient CI\CD in place
        toggling via configuration change sounds reasonable. You'll make sure
        that application will be tested against configuration it's supposed to
        run with.
      </p>

      <h2>Run tests against both states before release</h2>
      <p>
        Before releasing do extra run with "on" state to spot potential broken
        tests. Yes, easy to forget and something to do manually, but generally
        speaking, might help.
      </p>

      <h2>Don't use production set of flags on stages</h2>
      <p>
        "Toggles on production enviroment shouldn't inpact staging enviroment"
        you might say. "But who then we are going to test it?" might someone
        argue.
      </p>

      <h2>In conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The list goes on and on and I don't have a setteled answer for your team
        apart from the first two points mentioned. Would like to hear your
        experience and don't forget to delete an obsolete feature flag ;)
